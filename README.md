# KML-Builder-For-Kerberos-SDR
This is a proof of concept to be further built upon for interfacing the KerberosSDR with Ozzmaker's BerryGPS and IMU v4 in order to compile data from both sources and build a KML file to show accurate lines of bearing regardless of which direction antenna array is facing.
